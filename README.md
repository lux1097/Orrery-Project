This is the arduino code for that controls the Orrery that was designed for Otago Museum at the end of 2022 as part of my coursework while studying Bachelor of Engineering Technology (Mechatronics). Remote XY android app is used to control the arduino inputs and outputs acting as a control panel for controlling orrery movements and the arduino has wifi module that helps to communicate with the remote XY app in the mobile or tablet of the user. This sketch involves controlling seven servo motors(parallax 360 high speed servo motor), and uses ESP8266 Wifi Module to connectc to the Remote XY app
